# Counter-Strike Deathmatch Mod – Sentry Gun | Dispenser | Laser Mine | VIP Shop
A deathmatch mod with a lot of features.
This project was started back in June 2020 for Ro{Y}aL WarLand Community.
Since, it has been lying in my computer for a long time and the community has been closed already.
So, I decided to release this project.
Please don't remove credits.
Features:
1) Custom Main Menu. (Press N to open)
2) Sentry Gun Mod with 3 upgradable levels (Thanks to JGHG)
  - Players can build 4 while VIPs can build 6 Sentries
3) Dispenser with 4 levels.
  - Players can build 2 dispensers while VIPs can build 4 dispensers.
4) Laser Mine with 4 different levels.
  - Limit of laser mines vary on the admin level per person.
6) Knife Menu with 7 different types of knives, which gives benefits accordingly.
7) Custom Shop (Thanks to OciXCrom)
8) VIP System with lot of privileges.
  - VIP Menu, VIP Shop, Extra damage, speed and more.
11) Admin Menu with lot of functions.
And more features you may experience when you will run the mod in your server.

**Bugs:**: Downloading issues with Ak47 Paladin and M4a1 Dark Knight models (Disabled the plugins for now). 
**Credits:** CSDM Team, JGHG, pro100web, serfreeman1337, OciXCrom, VeCo, Dias, schmurgel1983 (Sincere apologies if I missed someone).
**NOTE:** If you experience any lag in your server, try disabling the excess plugins. NO support will be provided for this project as I don’t code for CS 1.6 anymore.
